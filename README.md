## Heroes of Hammerwatch mod
# StatsSystem
This mod gives you the ability to spend points into the stats you want instead of gaining a certain amount each level.
Bloodrites should also be removed from the game for proper balancing, no use in getting so OP that stats aren't useful.

# Required
https://github.com/thyraxx/MoreHooks/releases/latest
And enable both mods from the main menu.

# Usage
With **F6** you can open the stats window.

In console you can type **reset_points true** to claim back all spent points.

When Holding shift OR Ctrl (left Ctrl opens your char window tho! So it is possible to use the right ctrl if that's available to you), you can spend 5 or 10 points instead of clicking tons of times.

### How do I enable mods?
1. Click the "Profiles" button in the main menu. (It's the button left of the Singleplayer button)

2. Click "Clone this profile" so that you have a secondary profile to use for modding. (Note: Enabling mods on a profile disables achievements for that profile!)

3. Click the "Change mods" button (the button with the cog) for the secondary profile. (You might be asked whether you're sure you want to continue adding mods, click Yes.)

4. Select the mods you want to use and click OK. Mods are now enabled on that profile!

Have fun!
