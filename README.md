## Heroes of Hammerwatch mod
# StatsSystem
This mod gives you the ability to spend points into the stats you want instead of gaining a certain amount each level.
Bloodrites should also be removed from the game for proper balancing, no use in getting so OP that stats aren't useful.

# Required
https://github.com/thyraxx/MoreHooks/releases/latest

# Usage
With **F6** you can open the stats window.

In console you can type **reset_points true** to claim back all spent points.

When Holding shift OR Ctrl (left Ctrl opens your char window tho! So it is possible to use the right ctrl if that's available to you), you can spend 5 or 10 points instead of clicking tons of times.
